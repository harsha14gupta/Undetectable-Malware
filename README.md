# Undetectable-Malware
With the right mindset, understanding, and application, This project is created to gain insight on how to build the ethical hacking tool called Malware.

## Disclaimer âš 
The purpose is to allow the study of malware and enable people who are interested in malware analysis to have access to live malware, analyse the ways they operate, and maybe even enable advanced and savvy people to block specific malware within their own environment.
This is to be used only for educational purposes. It is recommended to run them in a VM which has no internet connection (or an internal virtual network) and without guest additions or any equivalents.

## Environment Used ðŸ’»
Kali Linux (v2019.4) virtual machine on VMware Workstation 16 Player

## Libraries Used ðŸ“„
- Standard Library Functions <bits/stdc++.h>
- Unix Standard Library <unistd.h>
- Winsock Function Library <winsock2.h>
- Windows API Function Library <windows.h> and <windowsx.h>
- Windows Controls Library <winuser.h>
- Proxy Auto-Config Helper Function Library <wininet.h> 
- C POSIX Library <sys/stat.h> 
- Basic Derived Types <sys/types.h>
- Defines the Type socklen_t <sys/socket.h>
- Internet Address Family <netinet/in.h>
- Internet Addresses Manipulating <arpa/inet.h>

## Implementation ðŸ’¡
This malware can be implemented using C programming language in the order mentioned below:
- Create the connection with our server (inside a main function)
- Create a shell function (wait for incoming command and iterate over certain options)
- Automatically start program when machine is rebooted
- Start/spawn other programs
- Navigate through different directories
- Implement keylogger to our backdoor
